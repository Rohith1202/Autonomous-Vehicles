# 🚗 Autonomous Self-Driving Car using Udacity Simulator

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents the development of an autonomous driving model using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), trained on driving behavior data collected from the **Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator**. The objective is to predict steering angles from camera images in real time, enabling the vehicle to drive autonomously within the simulated environment.

The approach emphasizes:
- **End-to-end deep learning** for behavioral cloning.
- **Data augmentation** to increase robustness.
- **Efficient training pipeline** to minimize overfitting.
- **Real-time simulation testing** using the Udacity simulator.

## 🛠️ Model Training Pipeline

### 1. 📥 Data Loading
- Reads driving log data from `driving_log.csv`.
- Utilizes images from **center**, **left**, and **right** cameras.
- Combines image paths and steering measurements.

### 2. 🎨 Data Augmentation
To improve model generalization, the following augmentations are applied:
- **Flipping** images horizontally and reversing the steering angle.
- **Brightness adjustment** to simulate varying lighting conditions.
- **Camera offset correction** for left/right images with adjusted steering angles.
- **Shuffling** and **balancing** data distribution.

### 3. 🧠 Model Architecture
A CNN model inspired by **NVIDIA’s end-to-end self-driving car architecture** was built using Keras:
- Input normalization and cropping layers.
- Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation.
- Fully connected layers with dropout regularization.
- Final output: single neuron predicting the **steering angle**.

### 4. ⚙️ Training Configuration
- Optimizer: `Adam`
- Loss Function: `Mean Squared Error (MSE)`
- Epochs: Configurable (default: 5–10 recommended)
- Batch Size: 64
- Early stopping and model checkpointing are implemented for stability.

### 5. 📊 Visualization
- Loss vs Epochs plot to observe convergence.
- Model testing results with optional prediction overlay visuals.
